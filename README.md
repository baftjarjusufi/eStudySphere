## Deployment

‚Ä¢The project repository can be cloned from the GitHub link provided  : https://github.com/baftjarjusufi/estudysphere.git

‚Ä¢	Alternatively, the Zip folder can be downloaded from the same link and extracted to a preferred location.
‚Ä¢	Once the user opens Visual Studio Code, they should navigate to the folder where the estudysphere project is located.
‚Ä¢	A new terminal (preferably a Shell) should be opened, and the user can proceed to execute the following commands.
‚Ä¢	It is important to always verify that the correct path is being used : ‚ÄúPS C:\Users\User\Desktop\estudysphere>‚Äù
As this project was developed within a virtual environment, the user will also need to create their own virtual environment.
1.	python -m venv env 

replace env if the user wants with a different name .

2.	env\scripts\activate ‚Äì then user should activate their virtual environment , user should see : ‚Äú(env) PS C:\Users\User \Desktop\estudysphere>‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Once the virtual environment is created , dependencies can be installed.
3.	pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt


‚Ä¢	The user is now almost done, they just need to perform the migration and open the live server.
4.	python manage.py migrate
5.	python manage.py runserver

‚Ä¢	The user can access the estudysphere application by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Lessons Learned

In conclusion, this project has been a valuable learning experience in Django web development. It allowed me to gain practical knowledge in building a web application that facilitates the creation, management, and interaction of users within a website application. Through this project, I have mastered essential Django concepts, HTML, CSS and Javascript concepts including user authentication, database modeling, form handling, the use of the Django Admin interface, making the front end django friendly , incorporating the back-end with front-end together.
